## Usage

This project provides code and scripts to train the salary price prediction model, make predictions, and evaluate its performance.

To train the model, run the following command:

```
python train_model.py
```

To make predictions using the trained model, run:

```
python make_predictions.py
```

## Data

The data used for this project can be found in the `data` directory. It contains the training and testing datasets in CSV format. The columns include various features that are used for predicting salary prices.

## Model

The machine learning model used for salary price prediction is based on [describe the model used here, e.g., linear regression, random forest, etc.]. The model training and evaluation code can be found in the `model.py` script.

## Results

After training the model, the results and performance metrics can be found in the `results` directory. This includes various visualizations and evaluation metrics to assess the model's accuracy.

## Contributing
